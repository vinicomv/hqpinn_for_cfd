# Hybrid Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Network
This repository provides a pedagogical implementation of a Hybrid Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Network (HQPINN), a neural network model that incorporates a (in this case, simulated) quantum layer. The network is applied to approximate solutions of the Burgers equation, a standard benchmark problem in computational fluid dynamics.

For comparison, we also include a purely classical PINN variant, in which the quantum layer is replaced by a fully connected classical layer.

The notebook includes brief explanations of the model’s functionality between code cells.
For a deeper theoretical and methodological background, please refer to (and cite!) our related work: “Hybrid Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks” (arXiv:2510.14099)

This repository is intended as an educational resource. The pedagogical content is still a work in progress, and further refinements and explanations will be added in future updates.
